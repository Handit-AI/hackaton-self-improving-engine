- Temporal anomalies (unusual times, day patterns)
- Geographic behavioral changes (location patterns, travel)
- Merchant preference shifts (new vs familiar merchants)
- Transaction velocity changes (sudden spikes or drops)
- Device and channel patterns (mobile, web, ATM usage)

evaluation_criteria: ["Does the output explicitly compare current behavior to historical baselines?", "Are 'consistent/inconsistent' claims justified with INPUT-backed evidence?", "Does the output handle sparse history with appropriate uncertainty?", "Does it avoid non-behavioral policy talk?"]
