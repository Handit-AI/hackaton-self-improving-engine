# SimpleFraudAgent - Structured Output ✅

## ✅ What Changed

The `SimpleFraudAgent` now returns **structured JSON output** instead of unstructured text.

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### ❌ Before
```python
# Returns unstructured text
{
    "decision": "Based on the information provided, the transaction appears to be consistent with the user's spending pattern... Therefore, I would assess the risk of this transaction as low and recommend APPROVE.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided, the transaction appears to be consistent with the user's spending pattern... Therefore, I would assess the risk of this transaction as low and recommend APPROVE."
}
```

### ✅ After
```python
# Returns structured JSON
{
    "decision": "APPROVE",
    "reasoning": "Transaction consistent with user's spending pattern and history. Healthcare professional purchasing medical equipment. High merchant rating."
}
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### 1. **System Prompt**
```python
"You are a fraud detection expert. Analyze transactions and return structured output.

Your response must be JSON with:
{
    "decision": "APPROVE" or "DECLINE",
    "reasoning": "brief explanation of your decision"
}"
```

### 2. **User Prompt**
```python
"Transaction: {transaction}

Analyze this transaction and determine if it should be APPROVED or DECLINED.

Return JSON:
{
    "decision": "APPROVE" or "DECLINE",
    "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}"
```

### 3. **Response Format**
```python
response_format={"type": "json_object"},
temperature=0.3
```

### 4. **Result Parsing**
```python
result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
return {
    "decision": result.get("decision", "DECLINE"),
    "reasoning": result.get("reasoning", "")
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Clean Decision**: Direct "APPROVE" or "DECLINE"  
✅ **Clean Reasoning**: Brief explanation  
✅ **Structured**: Easy to parse and use  
✅ **Reliable**: JSON format ensures consistency  
✅ **Better Bullets**: Clear reasoning for bullet generation  

---

## 🚀 Usage

```python
agent = SimpleFraudAgent()
result = agent.analyze(transaction)

# Clean access
decision = result["decision"]      # "APPROVE" or "DECLINE"
reasoning = result["reasoning"]    # Brief explanation
```

## 📊 Model Configuration

- **Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` (fast, cost-effective)
- **Temperature**: `0.3` (balanced creativity)
- **Format**: `json_object` (structured output)

---

## ✅ Result

Now the agent returns clean, structured output:
- Clear decision class
- Brief reasoning text
- JSON format for easy parsing
- Better for bullet generation

The system is now production-ready! 🎉
